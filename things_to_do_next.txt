1. Unwind table generation doesn't have to happen if the mappings are cachedLabels
2. Clean up the code
3. Add JIT checks?
4. Refresh PIDs from time to time
5. Debugging endpoint
6. Re-do unwind info if shards are full

================
later
- don't write all the time
- reuse buffers

================

1. Read the code
2. Make it better
3. Try to improve it
4. Add WebUI
5. Add JIT detection?
6. Do lots of testing (edge cases etc)
7. Add caching




== bugs

- nginx fails sometimes
- make && sudo dist/parca-agent --node=test --remote-store-insecure  --remote-store-address=127.0.0.1:7070 --experimental-enable-dwarf-unwinding --debug-process-names="(systemd|python|ruby|irb|bash)" fails

perhaps and edge case?
